arr = [1, 2, 3, -2, 5]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: Max subarray sum is 9 of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which is a contiguous subarray.

# Method1 - Brute force

print(f"subarray with maximum sum is: {mx}")
print(f"elements with maximum sum is from index:{start} to {end}")
print(f"subarray elements with maximum sum: {arr[start:end+1]}")

# Output
# subarray with maximum sum is: 6
# elements with maximum sum is from index:3 to 6
# subarray elements with maximum sum: [4, -1, 2, 1]

# Time Complexity: O(n^3)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# Output
# subarray with maximum sum is: 6
# elements with maximum sum is from index:3 to 6
# subarray elements with maximum sum: [4, -1, 2, 1]

# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# Method3 - Kadane's Algorithm
# Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm:
# Explanation: This is the most efficient approach to solve the problem.
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# statement:
# The algorithm maintains a running sum and tracks the maximum sum encountered so far.
# If the running sum becomes negative, it resets to 0, as continuing with a negative sum would only decrease the total sum.
