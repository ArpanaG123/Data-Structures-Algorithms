# Given an array of integers. Find the Inversion Count in the array.  Two elements arr[i] and arr[j] form an inversion if arr[i] > arr[j] and i < j.
# Inversion Count: For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0.
# If an array is sorted in the reverse order then the inversion count is the maximum. 


arr = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
