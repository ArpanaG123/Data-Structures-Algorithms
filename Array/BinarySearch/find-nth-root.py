# Input: n = 2, m = 9
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 32 = 9

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        mid_power_n = mid ** n  # Calculate mid raised to the power of n

            return mid
        elif mid_power_n > m:  # If mid^n is greater than m, reduce the high bound
            high = mid - 1
        else:  # If mid^n is less than m, increase the low bound
            low = mid + 1
