# Basic - Binary Trees
# Binary Tree allow hirearchical organisation and structire of multilevel sequence.
# Binary tree consist of root node,child node and leaf node.

# Root node - the topmost node of binary tree from which all other node stem out.
# Child node - It is directly connected to a parent node.In BT, a parent can have zero,one or teo children.
# Leaf node - The node that do not have any children.

# Types of Binary Tree
# 1.Full BT
# 2.Complete BT
# 3.Perfect BT
# 4.Balanced BT
# 5.Degenerate Tree
