# Delete Node in a BST
# Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/

# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
# Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
# Search for a node to remove.
# If the node is found, delete the node.
 
# Example:
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
# Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
# Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
# One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
# Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
